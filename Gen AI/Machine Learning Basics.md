### **Supervised Learning**

- **What:** You train a model using labeled data (input + correct output).
- **Example:** Predicting house prices.
    - Input (features): size, location, number of rooms
    - Output (label): price
- **Use in GenAI:** Not directly, but used in training smaller models like classifiers or fine-tuning.

### **Unsupervised Learning**

- **What:** You only have inputs, and want to find patterns.
- **Example:** Clustering users by behavior (without knowing labels).
- **Use in GenAI:** Used in **embedding clustering**, **topic modeling**, etc.

### **Reinforcement Learning (optional but good to know)**

- **What:** The model learns by taking actions and receiving rewards.
- **Example:** AI playing a game like chess or driving.
- **Use in GenAI:** ChatGPT was fine-tuned using **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)**.
